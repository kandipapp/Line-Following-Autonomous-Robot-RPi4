Line Following Autonomous Robot Car
Project Overview
This project develops an autonomous robot car powered by Raspberry Pi 4 that can follow black and coloured lines on a track while performing symbol and shape recognition using Python and OpenCV. The robot car is designed to navigate complex tracks, differentiate multiple colours, recognize various symbols and arrows, and complete the course autonomously within a specified time.

Features
-Fully autonomous control using Raspberry Pi 4
-Black and coloured line detection and following
-Shape, arrow, and symbol recognition on the track
-Real-time image processing with OpenCV
-Ability to follow designated coloured paths and ignore others

Repository Contents
-Python scripts for line detection and tracking
-Symbol and shape recognition algorithms
-Configuration files and resources for testing
-Documentation and notes related to the project

Requirements
-Raspberry Pi 4
-Python 3.11.2
-OpenCV
-Other dependencies (see requirements.txt if available)
 
Usage
Run the main script to start the robot car operation:
